# Kinome Cluster

A working example of Kinome Cluster can be found at http://kinobus.github.io/kinome-cluster


Kinome Overlay/Kinome Cluster is an open source, client-side web application that allows a bench scientist to upload siRNA screen results, MS based quantitative phosphoproteomics runs, or other kinomic datasets. Kinome Overlay/Kinome Cluster generates a scatterplot that is overlaid on the Human Kinome dendrogram published in The Protein Kinase Complement of the Human Genome
G Manning, DB Whyte, R Martinez, T Hunter, S Sudarsanam (2002). The resulting image generated is an SVG graphic that may be exported and used freely.


Intensity values are uploaded as a CSV file (newline delimited rows, comma-separated columns with double-quotes demarcating strings) of key-value pairs of Gene IDs coinciding with the log-2 transform of the intensity value from experimental data.


Kinome Overlay/Kinome Cluster is developed by Nick Robin of the University of Washington and Joseph Lee of Portland State University and may be distributed under the MIT License.
